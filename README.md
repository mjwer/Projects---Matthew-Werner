The projects within in this repository are some examples of my work throughout graduate school.

Sentiment Analysis:
- Utilized R Programming Language to analyze multiple reviews pertaining to one particular hotel.
Obtained not only the overall approval/disapproval of those reviews, but the customers underlying sentiment relative to key words and the most/least frequent words used in conjunction with those key words throughout their review.
- This dataset is from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315872294_Sentiment_Classification_of_Consumer_Generated_Online_Reviews_Using_Topic_Modeling

Linked List:
- Utilized Python Programming Language to create a linked list which would be tested against
different sets of code. Each test needed to produce an output that
matched the output from the corresponding text file. Test files and
output text files were created by our professor, Dr. Meyers.
- I encourage you to run the test files on my linkedList python code and cross reference the results with the output text files.
